# The-Matrix-rain-of-symbols
The Matrix's rain of symbols has a distinct aesthetic appearance.
It has become a symbol of rebellion, technology, and the merging of the virtual and physical worlds.
This program is my way of creating similar visual effects in the standard console view.
I created this program when I was learning about threads and needed a way to get started.
